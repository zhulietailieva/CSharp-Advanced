Overview
In this workshop, we are going to create another custom data structure, which has similar functionalities as the C# doubly linked list. Just like the structures from the previous workshop, our custom doubly linked list will work only with integers. It will have the following functionalities: 
void AddFirst(int element) – adds an element at the beginning of the collection
void AddLast(int element) – adds an element at the end of the collection
int RemoveFirst() – removes the element at the beginning of the collection
int RemoveLast() – removes the element at the end of the collection
void ForEach() – goes through the collection and executes a given action
int[] ToArray() – returns the collection as an array
Feel free to implement your functionality or to write the methods by yourself.
